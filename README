This project was created for my 8th grade history class. The user plays an
escapee from Libby Prison, Richmond. After the protagonist escapes, he's
greated by a negro, Jack, who offers to help him find some food. Jack guides
him to a nearby house where Prince, another negro, and his wife provide him
with some much neeeded food. After the protagonist is finished eating, Jack
gives him directions to the nearby town of Ashland, where he believes the 
protagonist will be able to find help.

This project was coded in C++ using Visual Studio 2010, Sublime Text 2, and
Xcode 4. The code is not very efficiently written. It was planned to create
a struct that would hold the scene's text and what the next scene would be.
All of the struct's instances would have their content stored in a file that
would be read in a while loop to create all of the appropriate instances.
Unfortunately, I did not have the time to figure out the logistics of this
system and I was forced to create a storyLine() function instead. The
storyLine() function is simply a bunch of std::cout statements along with
switch statements to create the storyline.
